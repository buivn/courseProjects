    "You are *highly recommended* to LaTeX your solutions to this assignment and use the 10pt, 2-column `ieeeconf` template. You can find the template [on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/preparation-of-papers-for-ieee-sponsored-conferences-and-symposia/zfnqfzzzxghk); Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor with a free tier, so feel free to use that service to compose your writeups. It is perhaps the easiest option, particularly if you are not as familiar with LaTeX. While there is no space limit, please try to keep your plots compact so that they do not consume an enormous amount of space; mostly this helps readability (and therefore grading). You are allowed to work in small groups (2 or 3 students), but your solutions and your writeup should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these homework assignments, I expect that your solutions will be written as if they are research papers: though the content is not \"new\", you should be trying to convince me through your writing that you have implemented and understand the algorithms. You should write in full sentences. When appropriate, comment on when the algorithms succeed or fail and where they are more or less effective; include numbers/metrics (quantitative) in addition to discussion (qualitative) whenever possible. Just like in a published paper, you should not include code snippets in your writeup unless it is explicitly asked for or you think it helps you explain your results or answer the question. **I will ask you to submit both the PDF of your writeup *and* a .zip file containing your code (which may be a modified form of this Jupyter notebook) on Blackboard. Unless asked, do not include code in your writeup. You should present your results well enough that I trust your implementation was sufficient.** Though it would be nice if your code were cleaned up and nicely formatted/commented, we will are only likely to run your code to evaluate partial credit or unless we are skeptical for academic integrity reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to work in small groups of 2 or 3 students, but please write your solutions independently: I would like your answers to the more conceptual questions to be in your own words, even if you discussed the answers with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on your included plots and answers to conceptual questions. Your code will not be directly graded or evaluated. You can receive partial credit on pretty much everything, and I try to be a fair as possible: giving you a grade that I think reflects your level of understanding of the material. Note that while I appreciate you submitting plots that you *know* are probably not quite right, it can be hard for me to evaluate partial credit if things are not quite working; in this case, try to include in your response a guess of where you think your solution didn't work. This will help me know when to give you more credit on your responses."

    "In class, we talked about PDDL as a language for representing task planning problems. While you won't be implementing the solver itself, in this problem you'll be using [Fast Downward](https://www.fast-downward.org/HomePage), an off-the-shelf PDDL solver.\n",

    "### P3.3.1 Running Fast Downward [4 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I have provided you with an example PDDL domain for you to experiment with. \n",
    "I have provided you with a Dockerfile that builds the code and starts a bash session inside the container, where you can run the example code. The `pddl` folder inside the same folder that contains this jupyter notebook is mounted inside the container: you can edit those files while Docker is running and those changes will appear inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Download and build Fast Downward. I have provided you with a Dockerfile that includes the installation and also includes [the Downward Benchmarks](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks). Run `make downward` to build the code and start `bash` session inside the Docker container, where you will be running `./fast-downward.py`.\n",

However it will take you at least 500 time steps to get there on the impulse drive and the faster-than-light \"warp drive\" is broken. The Enterprise requires new parts that are strewn around the system if it is to have any hope of reaching the system in time.\n",

Description: Ship ?s moves from ?l1 to ?l2 at warp speed (requiring that the warp drive is active); the adjacency and the travel costs are already included in the problem pddl file. Costs: given by `(warp-distance l1 l2)`, I've already provided you with these.\n",
    "- [new] `beam-up-supplies` Arguments: `?s - ship ?l - location ?p - supply` Ship ?s at location ?l beams up supplies ?p. Once the action is complete, the supplies are onboard the ship. Requires the away team. Cost: 1.\n",
    "- [new] `enable-warp-drive` Arguments: `?s - ship, ?pc - plasmaconduit, ?pi - plasmainjector, ?wc - warpcoil, ?di - dilithium`. Description: All of these supplies must be onboard ship ?s (you may want to define a new predicate for this: `on-ship`) and attached in the proper configuration. This action powers up the warp drive, enabling flight at warp speed afterwards. Cost: 3.\n",
