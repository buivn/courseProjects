1. decision tree program - hw2_dt.py: use python3 to run: python3 hw2_dt.py. you can set the depth parameters or Gini or entropy index.

2. bayesian classifier - hw2_bayesian.py: use python3 to run: python3 hw2_bayesian.py. No parameters need to be inputed.

3. k - nearest neighbor - hw2_knn.py: use python3 to run: python3 hw2_knn.py.py. The parameter k_nn can be changed to adjust the model.

4. Artificial neural network - hw2_ann: I ran this program on Google Colab. You can change the number of hidden layers, and number of nodes as calling the class Model.
