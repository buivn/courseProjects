    "## P5.1 Feature Matching with OpenCV [8 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, I showed you a demo of OpenCV and how sparse features could be used to locate a reference object \"in the wild\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Follow the [OpenCV tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/de0/tutorial_py_feature_homography.html) to implement feature matching (copy-pasting code is expected here) and confirm to yourself that \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will do this on an object of your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Find a *flat* object (a textbook with an interesting cover image is great for this) and take a clear reference photo of it. Crop that image and load it into python. Here's a reasonable function to load the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def load_image(filepath):\n",
    "    img = Image.open(filepath)\n",
    "    return (np.asarray(img).astype(float)/255)[:, :, :3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Take a few (3 or more) pictures of the object in different places or angles (and perhaps also lighting conditions) around your home or desk; feel free to try to fool the detector in one or two images, but try to show at least one where the matching works quite well. Run the OpenCV code from before to see if you can match features between the reference image and the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMAGES** Show the OpenCV feature matching code for your reference image compared to (at least) three others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RESPONSE** (3-6 sentences) Using your images, describe some of the features (parts of the image) or lighting/orientation conditions that work well and some that do not. Your response does not need to be detailed; I'm just looking to see that you've scrutinized your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FIGURE & DISCUSSION** Generate an image like the one in the tutorial but for the two transformed sunflower images I have included. How does the performance (e.g., in terms of the number of features or accuracy of matches) of the OpenCV system compare to the system you implemented? How much faster (roughly, I do not need a precise number) is the OpenCV system compared to yours?"

    "## P5.2: Structure from Motion with COLMAP [4 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "COLMAP is a package for Structure from Motion: the aim of which is to build a 3D map of sparse features from a video or series of images from a scene. I would now like you to try it here on your own video to build a 3D reconstructed scene. First, you should [download COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/install.html). I highly recommend you download one of the standalone executables, since then you do not have to worry about building the library yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A note for MacOS users: the newest version(s) of COLMAP did not work for me on my machine. I went back and download version 3.4 and that worked fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new folder that will serve as your COLMAP workspace. Record a video of a small scene on your phone and move it into the folder you have just created. To build a 3D scene, you will need to extract individual frames from the video; for this I recommend using the open-source tool [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org). With it, extracting frames is relatively easy. For example, at the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd colmap_demo\n",
    "mkdir images\n",
    "ffmpeg -i my_workspace.MOV -vf fps=3 \\\n",
    "    images/frame%04d.jpg -hide_banner\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I have used `fps=3` to indicate that I would only like to extract 3 images per second of video. No more than this should be necessary here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open COLMAP and navigate to `Reconstruction -> Automatic reconstruction` and populate the boxes:\n",
    "- Workspace folder: select a folder where the output will be stored;\n",
    "- Image folder: where you extracted your video frames;\n",
    "- Under `Data type` you can leave it as the default: `Individual frames`. Using `Video frames` tells the system that consecutive frames have a lot of overlapping features, which speeds up matching but I find degrades overall performance;\n",
    "- Be sure `Sparse model` is checked; I had issues with `Dense model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the system is done rendering (which hopefully will not take 20 hours... on my machine it took maybe 10 minutes for ~200 frames), increase the size of the 3D points using `Render -> Render options -> Point size +`. Usually the point size is pretty small, so you'll need to bump it up to visualize your scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the reconstructed model may not be in one piece. There are ways to [merge them at the command line](https://colmap.github.io/faq.html#merge-disconnected-models), but we won't worry about that here. However, you might want to open one of the other models. Navigating to `File -> Import model` and finding the `sparse` folder inside your workspace folder, selecting one of the sub-maps (named with just a number, starting at 0) will allow you to open and view it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RESULTS/QUESTION** Include at least 4 images of your scene from different orientations, being sure to show its 3D structure. Include 3-4 sentences describing where the reconstruction worked well and where it did not; what types of regions do not appear in your 3D reconstruction?\n"

However, the vaults are locked and you need to retrieve three artifacts (\"keys\" to each of the vaults) to unlock them. Upon unlocking all three vaults, you are to travel to the planet Levinia, deliver the message and thus allow the USS Enterprise to rescue a group of civilians that are in danger from temporal anomalies. It's not the most glamorous mission, but someone's gotta do it.\n",
