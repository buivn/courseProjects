    "You are *highly recommended* to LaTeX your solutions to this assignment and use the 10pt, 2-column `ieeeconf` template. You can find the template [on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/preparation-of-papers-for-ieee-sponsored-conferences-and-symposia/zfnqfzzzxghk); Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor with a free tier, so feel free to use that service to compose your writeups. It is perhaps the easiest option, particularly if you are not as familiar with LaTeX. While there is no space limit, please try to keep your plots compact so that they do not consume an enormous amount of space; mostly this helps readability (and therefore grading). You are allowed to work in small groups (2 or 3 students), but your solutions and your writeup should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these homework assignments, I expect that your solutions will be written as if they are research papers: though the content is not \"new\", you should be trying to convince me through your writing that you have implemented and understand the algorithms. You should write in full sentences. When appropriate, comment on when the algorithms succeed or fail and where they are more or less effective; include numbers/metrics (quantitative) in addition to discussion (qualitative) whenever possible. Just like in a published paper, you should not include code snippets in your writeup unless it is explicitly asked for or you think it helps you explain your results or answer the question. **I will ask you to submit both the PDF of your writeup *and* a .zip file containing your code (which may be a modified form of this Jupyter notebook) on Blackboard. Unless asked, do not include code in your writeup. You should present your results well enough that I trust your implementation was sufficient.** Though it would be nice if your code were cleaned up and nicely formatted/commented, we will are only likely to run your code to evaluate partial credit or unless we are skeptical for academic integrity reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to work in small groups of 2 or 3 students, but please write your solutions independently: I would like your answers to the more conceptual questions to be in your own words, even if you discussed the answers with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on your included plots and answers to conceptual questions. Your code will not be directly graded or evaluated. You can receive partial credit on pretty much everything, and I try to be a fair as possible: giving you a grade that I think reflects your level of understanding of the material. Note that while I appreciate you submitting plots that you *know* are probably not quite right, it can be hard for me to evaluate partial credit if things are not quite working; in this case, try to include in your response a guess of where you think your solution didn't work. This will help me know when to give you more credit on your responses.\n"

As such, position is not enough and we cannot use `gtsam.Point2`; instead we need `gtsam.Pose2`.

    "Each laser scan is given as a list of floats. Each element of the scan . We call this vector the \"ranges\" since each point gives us the distance (or range) to the obstacles in that direction.\n",

    "We'll keep the observation model fairly simple for this assignment: we will compare the \"true scan\", the \"observed ranges\" generated by the robot itself and the \"simulated ranges\" that correspond to ranges that we generate from hypotential robot poses. By comparing the two, we will be able to tell how \"good\" that hypothetical pose is based on what we've seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Complete the `def prob_of_scan(observed_ranges, simulated_ranges, sigma=20)` function below. The likelihood of each point should be given by a gaussian distribution of std-dev sigma:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(r_o, r_s) = \\exp(- (r_o - r_s)^2 / \\sigma^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "You should compare the range for each of the pairs between the scans: the first range in the first scan with the first range of the second, and so on. The total likelihood is thus the product of the individual likelhoods for all pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RESULT** Run the \"results\" code below and include the results in your writeup. You should see that the likelihood of the \"true\" pose is very good and decreases for scans that look completely different. Sanity check your results against the scans generated in the code block above."
