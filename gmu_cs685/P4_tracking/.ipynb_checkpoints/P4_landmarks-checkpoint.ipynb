    "### 4.3.2 Linear Sum Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, matching using the function above has a limitation: it can associate multiple detections *per observation* to the same landmark if two landmarks are close together. This can be an issue if the landmarks tend to be \"clumped\". If you run the code below, you'll see exactly this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we hope to maximize the likelhood of an observation while ensuring that no two detections in a single observation are associated with the same landmark. We can do that using *Linear Sum Assignment* (also often known as the \"Hungarian Matching Algorithm\"). Here, you will use the scipy implementation of the LSA algorithm to perform data association.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the LSA algorithm, we need to define a cost matrix. We are hoping to maximize the likelhiood of a single observation, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log likelihood of that observation. The benefit of using a logarithm is that while liklihoods multiply, log-likehoods add, allowing us to use linear sum assignment. Each entry in the cost matrix will be the negative log likelihood (as computed by `l.prob_of_obs`) for associating a particular detection with a particular landmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix should have a number of rows equal to the number of number of observations. The number of columns is more tricky since you need to allow the landmark to either match to an existing landmark if the likelihood is high enough or to create a new landmark if none of the existing ones is likely. The LSA algorithm does not support \"creation of new landmarks\", so we'll fake it instead: we add columns with fake landmarks and if the algorithm decides to associate with one of these we make a new landmark instead. This means that the number of columns will be the number of landmarks + the number of observations (since each observation could potentially be 'associated' with a new/fake landmark). While the values of the \"left\" block of the matrix—corresponding to association with existing landmarks—will have values defined by (though not necessarily equal to) `l.prob_of_obs`, the other elements for association with new landmarks will all have values defined by (though not equal to) the `association_thresh` above. Using this description of the cost matrix, you should be able to implement data association using linear sum assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Implement the function `update_landmarks_lsa`, which has the same API as the `update_landmarks` function above. The function should rely on the `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` to associate detection to landmarks or decide whether a new landmark should be created. (You can `import scipy` for this.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we're going to put everything together: SLAM with both odometry and observations of nearby landmarks yet without access to the ground truth data associations. I have provided you with a function `update_positions_gtsam` below that you will complete. The purpose of this function is to take in all the observations so far (including both motion and the landmark observations) and update the poositions of both the robot and the landmarks themselves. I recommend you read through the function to get an idea of how it is intended to work and what's expected of you to complete. Below that function, I have included some plotting code that uses both `update_positions_gtsam` and your data association code to incrementally build a map.\n",

Instead, you should use the `Landmark` class that I have given you. Notice that for each landmark, a detection includes not only the position but also the `pose_ind`, the index of the pose at which that observation was collected. You will no doubt find this useful when constructing the `gtsam` graph.\n",
