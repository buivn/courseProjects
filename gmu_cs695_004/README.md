## final project:
The final project works on dual-agents planning to go through narrow passages. We consider agents with geometries working on continuous state/action spaces. Two agent cannot go through the narrow passage at the same time. The goal is to find a policy which one agent needs to sacrifice its short-term reward to achieve a long-term return for both agents reaching their goals. The ideas is to develop a RL and IRL framework which need expert demonstration.
