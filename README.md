## CS677_Algorithm Analysis
This repository consist of the code, algorithm studied from course CS677 Algorithm Analysis. \

1. bubbleSort_2direction.cpp This code sort an input array by two ways, go to right then go to left. Each loop the array will be reduce 2 sizes.\
2. mergeSortwithoutRecursion.cpp: This code sortes an array by merge Sort algorithm without using recursion.\
3. quicksortduplicateKeys.cpp: This code uses quicksort to sort an array and work very well if there is many duplicated Keys.\
4. checkMaxHeap.cpp: it will check whether an array is a max heap or not. Its running time is O(n)
